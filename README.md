# build v1.1.0
see [Build 1.1](./BUILD1.1.md)

# Notes

- `failed to invoke chaincode name:"lscc" , error: API error (400): OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "exec: \"chaincode\": executable file not found in $PATH": unknown`
    - means package name for golang-chaincode entrance is not `main`
- blockHeight(got from queryChain) indexing from 1, blockNumber in blockEvent starting from 0
- requirePeerCount <= peerCount - 1 (1 for peer itself)
- "2-of" collectionPolicy is not allowed
- dep could only be run under system $GOPATH,
- nodejs chaincode take longer time in install chaincode only.
- peer.response in chaincode.Init cannot be recovered from proposal response. stub.GetState is meaningless in Init 

# DONE

# TODO
- instantiate chaincode on Mac, context canceled
- discovery service, endorsement hints
- npm couchdb-dump in nodejs/couchdbDump.sh


# Fabric weakness
- gossip timeline is outside of blockchain,  for massive data scenario, gossip will fall behind transaction event
- `args.push(Buffer.from(request.fcn ? request.fcn : 'init', 'utf8'));` we should use fcn ='' as default
